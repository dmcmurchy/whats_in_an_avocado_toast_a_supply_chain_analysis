# [What's in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1685)

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply your data manipulation and analysis skills to conduct a supply chain analysis of the ingredients used in an avocado toast, using the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) database. This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. Through this analysis, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish.
